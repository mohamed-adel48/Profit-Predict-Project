# Profit Predict Project
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
## Description: 
ProfitPredict is my first machine learning project aimed at predicting startup profitability. Using a small but insightful dataset, the project explores the relationship between research & development (R&D) spending, administration costs, marketing expenditures, and geographic location (state) on the profit outcomes of startups. By applying machine learning techniques, I aim to develop a predictive model that helps business owners understand and forecast their profitability based on these critical factors.
## Dataset: 
This dataset includes information on startup expenses and profits, providing insights into business owners' spending habits and their impact on profitability:

R&D Spend: Amount invested in research and development.
Administration: Costs related to administrative functions like salaries, supplies, and utilities.
Marketing Spend: Expenditure on marketing activities to promote and increase sales.
State: Location where the startup operates, influencing market conditions and business performance.
Profit: Net income after deducting expenses from revenue, revealing which expenditures contribute most to profitability.
